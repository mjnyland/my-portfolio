                  {""}. I got to own the entire project from end-to-end. From
                  talking to users, creating prototypes, high-fidelity mockups,
                  and even helping write the code.

                  Do you consider yourself a brand designer or a product
                  designer?
                </p>
                <p className=" text-gray-500">
                  I've done both. Currently I'm focused on product. That said, I
                  love integrating brand with product and vice versa. That's why
                  I love working with startups. There's usually a need for that
                  combo in that environment.

                <p className=" text-gray-500">
                  Again, I've done both. I get that my background reads as "Jack
                  of all trades, master of none", but I let my curiosity be my
                  compass. I have a technical side to me that if I ignore, I
                  start to feel bored. I love coding, I love designing. I'm
                  stronger at design - but getting better at code everyday.
                  Currently focusing on Swift and SwiftUI.

                  What is the hardest thing about product vs brand?
                </p>
                <p className=" text-gray-500">
                  Brand designs are seen and interacted with, but they're not
                  really used. Products are used and relied on every day. That
                  requires a deep level of understanding of the customer and
                  their workflows. That said, Branding is easy to do good
                  enough, and insanely hard to exceptionally well. Harder than
                  product I would say.

                  I've made just about every mistake you can make. Every time
                  I've learned from it and gotten better. (Cliche, I know, but
                  true)

                  Sometimes I overthink. Sometimes thats a good thing, but most

                    Design isn't linear - it's messy. I don't bother with
                    step-by-step processes because it's unrealistic. I thrive in
                    vague, ever-changing environments. I consider this my
                    greatest strength.

                    I understand that trust goes both ways. I weight subject
                    experts' opinion heavily when making decisions, but I can
                    also communicate my own thoughts without being a jerk.
